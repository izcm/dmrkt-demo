# From forking hell, to forking great!

**_Breathing life into web3 demos_**

> An _izcm_ demo showcasing an end-to-end marketplace that warps time on a local Anvil fork to generate realistic and deterministic historical on-chain data.  
> Great for devs looking to level up their dev environments — and for those who want a fun, practical how-to on Web3 demos.
